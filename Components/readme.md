# Surface-GUI-Components

## MVVM-EA base components

This is a set of basic GUI components writen as views and viewmodels

Views are decoupled from each other, and from companion viewmodels.
This decoupling is handled by the use of signals and a SignalAggragator.

This set of basic components provide a multi-line TextArea control.

There is a _ToDo_ demo app that demonstrates this text-edit control.

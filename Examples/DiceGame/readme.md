# Surface GUI Dice Game

Yes it's my same old poker-dice game you've all seen on many platforms.    
Now, its back on my newly updated Surface framework!

## Note:
The framework and app have been bundled using my `Hot` dev-server.
I didn't minify so the bundle is readable!

Once again -- only two files -- one canvas -- fine-grained reactivity!

## Usage:
```
Click the 'Roll Button' to start.    
After each roll of the dice, you can 'click' a die to 'freeze' its value.    
Click again to toggle the frozen state. When frozen, value will be held!
After three rolls, you must select a score item.  
The blue highlighted numbers indicate possible scores that are available to select.
Have fun!
```
